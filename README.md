#Job Predictor using XGBoost

A machine learning project that predicts job outcomes based on candidate attributes using the XGBoost algorithm. The project uses a dataset of 19,000+ records, applies complete data preprocessing, and trains multiple ML models, with XGBoost achieving the best performance.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a high-accuracy predictive system that classifies or forecasts job outcomes using structured candidate data.
This helps HR teams, recruiters, and job seekers understand which factors influence job selection.
